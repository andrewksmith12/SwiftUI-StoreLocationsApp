This is an application I'm building to learn iOS development with SwiftUI. 
The primse here is that the application will help users connect to local small businesses to help support them during the coronavirus, but also because it's a new years resolution of mine to shop small businesses. 

I'll start out developing an application that shows static data hard coded into the app. 
Then I'll try and add location data, getting it to sort the list by the location of the store
Then maybe I'll add filtering by tags such as Food and Shopping
Then I'll consider integrating a database so that the list can be updated without a new app release.
